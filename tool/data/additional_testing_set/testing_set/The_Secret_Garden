I asked mother—and she said she’d ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.”
Very good, sir, answered Roach, wondering if he was to receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the orchards into water-gardens.
She had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Marthas mother.
The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Mary thought she knew whose it was.
“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,” Dickon chuckled.
Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.
Shut your eyes, said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India.
“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha.
“What does it want?” “It wants its mother,” said Dickon, smiling more and more.
“She thought you had gone mad like a dog,” said Mary, not at all admiringly.
“Ask him,” said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the robin.
I dont want a governess, said Mary sharply.
She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet.
Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.
The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient’s room was indeed rather astonishing to him.
The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her.
“Did Dickon teach you that?” asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.
Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple, an they knowed Mester Craven didnt like him to be talked about.
“Who is going to dress me?”
She liked old Ben Weatherstaff.
Look!” exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly.
Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes
Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.
He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his study and told her she might have her bit of earth.
I never thought I should see Dickon.
Did Dickon teach you that?
She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.
Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.
No! shouted Colin.
You wrap up warm an run out an play you, said Martha.
Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.
Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours.
At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others.
Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her.
You are going to be sent home, Basil said to her, at the end of the week.
“I canna’ do no swayin’ back’ard and for’ard,” said Ben Weatherstaff.
I will ring for you when I want you to take her away, said Mr. Craven.
I have to do what you please, sir, Martha faltered, turning quite red.
Your obedient servant, Susan Sowerby.
But he doesnt call it Magic.
When he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man.
He looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him.
When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants’ hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads.
Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least.
Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up and down, down and up.
In the garden, he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he stood and repeated it again and again.
An they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colins cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin, if any of, ems about.
“Go and get it!” said Colin, digging excitedly.
And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid.
I wanted mine this morning, said Colin.
She told me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.
Colin looked rather like a picture himself.
Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.”
Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon.
And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was.
“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary.
That is my first scientific discovery.
He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy’s face.
He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang “Mistress Mary, quite contrary”; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her.
When Martha told stories of what “mother” said or did they always sounded comfortable.
Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.
Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.
“Well,” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, “that’s true.
Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.
“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?” she inquired.
It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.
It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin straight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.
“These won’t grow up in a night,” said Weatherstaff.
Everybody is in bed and I dont care about Mrs. MedlockI
“The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would get Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor.
She is such a plain child, Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.
Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little chanting song in Hindustani.
Mary made no response.
“That’d be a fine start for him,” said Susan Sowerby.
I know you dont, Basil answered.
If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.
I never saw it in India because there wasnt any, said Mary.
You neednt expect to see him, because ten to one you wont, said Mrs. Medlock.
The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha attend to me when she wants to go out.
“I hate black things,” said Mary.
A bit of earth, he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something.
Tha must take off tha cap, he said to Colin, an so mun tha, Benan tha mun stand up, tha knows.
He was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet, but Marys face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.
iss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed.
Colin broke forth fiercely.
One of th worst fits he ever had, said Martha, was one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain.
A little later the nurse made Colin ready.
Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been running herself.
“It’s gorse on th’ moor that’s openin’ out,” answered Dickon.
 “Lots o’ fools,” said Ben.
“It’s the strangest house anyone ever lived in,” said Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.
Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room.
That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.
She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing Dickon had said.
She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead.
They’re almost as friendly as dogs—if you know how to get on with ’em.
“Aye,” said Dickon. “An’ it’ll be greener and greener till th’ gray’s all gone.
Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his beak.
Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India.
“Hush-h! my boy,” Dr. Craven soothed him.
